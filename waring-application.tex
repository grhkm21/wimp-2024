The \textit{Goldbach conjecture} has also been attacked by the circle method. More specifically, the circle method has been applied to the \textit{weak} Goldbach conjecture, which asks whether every odd integer \(\geq 7\) can be written as the sum of \(3\) primes.

Vinogradov proved an asymptotic version of the result in 1937, and Helfgott proved the full version in 2013.
